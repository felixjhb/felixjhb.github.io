Hello! I'm Felix Bradley: a British mathematician and computer scientist researching in type theory. I'm a postgraduate researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, and I'm currently working on topics including bounded quantification, power types, pure subtype systems, and the use of subtyping in homotopy type theory

I am supervised by [Prof. Zhaohui Luo](https://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/zhaohui/), and advised by [Dr. Argyrios Deligkas](https://sites.google.com/view/deligkas/home). You can find more information on my work via my [Pure researcher profile](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/felix-bradley).

With my colleagues Dr. Julien Lange, Dr. Reuben Rowe and Dr. Francisco Ferreira, I co-organise the [Proofs and Programs Club](https://papc-rhul.github.io/), an extra-curricular club teaching students how to use proof assistants, and involving them in software verification research.
